                <h2>Empowerment</h2>

                <p>
                    Computer literacy, Business development, money skills and Jobs hunting: LCM assists homeless to find work by CV writing,
                    State document application or renewal, providing transport on job hunting and first month of work. We also empower them
                    with money skills enables them to manage wisely their finances. LCM identifies talented people and encourages them to
                    develop that. The skills obtained help them to get secure job or start a small business. LCM teaches disadvantaged to
                    fish rather than begging daily. As result after a period of time some became very independents from streets, shelters
                    and society
